## Installation 

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Libraries:
Pandas.
numpy.
matplotlib.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What are the most common languages used by professional developers?
2. What is the average salary for each programming language?
3. Which programming language has the highest job satisfaction?

## File Descriptions

The notebook accessible here exhibits work related to the above questions.


## Results

The most discoveries of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@moulikaachhe/few-insights-depicts-the-better-programmer-career-fc8f9dd05371).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
